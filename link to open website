1. The Adena Pipe is one of the most famous ancient artifacts ever found in Ohio. It was found in 1901 during the excavation of the mound in Chillicothe for which the Adena culture is named. The pipe is typical of that culture in that it is tubular and made of Ohio pipestone. The bowl opening is between the figure's feet. The much smaller mouthpiece opening is on the top of the head.



2. The Koh-i-Noor also spelt Kohinoor and Koh-i-Nur, is one of the largest cut diamonds in the world, weighing 105.6 carats (21.12 g),[a] and part of the British Crown Jewels. Probably mined in Golconda, India, there is no record of its original weight, but the earliest well-attested weight is 186 old carats (191 metric carats or 38.2 g). Koh-i-Noor is Hindi-Urdu and Persian for "Mountain of Light", it has been known by this name since the 18th century. It changed hands between various factions in modern-day India, Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan, until being ceded to Queen Victoria after the British conquest of the Punjab in 1849.


3. Discovered in Rosetta, Egypt by a French officer in 1799, this 2,200-year-old black basalt stone is now a famous artifact is inscribed in hieroglyphic, demotic and Greek and is believed to hold the key to deciphering hieroglyphics and Egypt's past. The stone was acquired by the British when they defeated the French in 1801, and transferred it to the British Museum in London in 1802. Although Egypt has continued to push for the stone's return, the British Museum refuses to budge.
